500 ml Premier Protein Shake (or similar protein shake with a complete amino acid profile)
Powder Additives:

1 scoop (approx. 25-30g) Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein Powder (or any complete protein powder)
1 scoop (approx. 5g) BCAA Powder (e.g., Optimum Nutrition BCAA)

1 Calcium Tablet (e.g., Citracal Calcium Citrate)
1 Magnesium Tablet (e.g., Nature Made Magnesium Oxide 400mg)
1 Iron Tablet (e.g., Ferro-Sequels High Potency Iron Supplement)
1 Comprehensive Amino Acid Tablet (e.g., Now Sports Amino Complete)
Instructions:

Prepare the Electrolyte Solution:

Dissolve 1 sachet (74g) of Pocari Sweat Powder in 500 ml of water in a large mixing container.
Add Protein Shake:

Add 500 ml of Premier Protein Shake to the container with the dissolved Pocari Sweat.
Add Powder Additives:

Add 1 scoop (25-30g) of Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein Powder to the liquid mixture.
Add 1 scoop (5g) of BCAA Powder to the mixture.
Add 1 scoop (5g) of Electrolyte Powder to the mixture. If using Nuun tablets, dissolve them in a small amount of water first, then add.
Add 1 scoop (10g) of Greens Powder to the mixture.
Add 1 teaspoon (5g) of Vitamin C Powder to the mixture.
Prepare and Add Crushed Tablets:

Using a mortar and pestle or a pill crusher, crush 2 multivitamin tablets into a fine powder and add to the mixture.
Crush 1 calcium tablet into a fine powder and add to the mixture.
Crush 1 magnesium tablet into a fine powder and add to the mixture.
Crush 1 iron tablet into a fine powder and add to the mixture.
Crush 1 comprehensive amino acid tablet into a fine powder and add to the mixture.
Mix Thoroughly:

Stir the mixture thoroughly to ensure all powders and crushed tablets are fully dissolved.
You may use a blender to ensure a homogeneous mixture.
Final Adjustments:

Check the consistency and ensure there are no undissolved particles.
Optionally, strain the mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove any remaining particles.
Storage:

Store the prepared nutrient solution in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
Shake well before each use to ensure ingredients remain evenly distributed.
